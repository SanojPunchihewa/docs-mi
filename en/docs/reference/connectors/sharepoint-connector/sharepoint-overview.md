# Sharepoint Connector Overview

SharePoint is a collaboration and document management platform that allows businesses to organize, share, and manage content across teams. It offers features such as site creation, document libraries, lists, and workflow automation.

The SharePoint Connector enables you to access the SharePoint API. This allows you to create, update, and delete sites, lists, libraries, and other SharePoint resources.

To find the Sharepoint Connector, go to the [WSO2 Connector Store](https://store.wso2.com) and search for "Sharepoint".
