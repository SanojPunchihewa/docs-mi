# Google Ads Connector Overview

Google Firebase is a rich modern platform to create quick mobile app back-ends, with a ton of built-in and ready-to-integrate features. The most used feature of Firebase is as a back-end. However, along with this back-end, one of the popular features is **push notifications**. We can register Android, IOS, and Web-based backend to Google Firebase applications and push notifications to them. Firebase being a Google product, a lot of people use it for reliable push notifications. In the mobile world, push notifications are very popular.  

You can use the Firebase console itself to trigger out messages to the registered devices or you can even schedule a CRON job. Firebase provides a `Messaging Console`, which you can use to send all kinds of push messages, filter target users, schedule messages, and much more. Needless to state, it provides notification history and reports as well. However, when it come to integration scenarios we should be able to generate a notification externally and send it to Google Firebase.
